# Audio Files for DJ Mixes

## Current Setup
All DJ mixes use the same demo audio file:
- `Unique - Original Mix.mp3` - Optimized demo audio file (smaller size)

## Available Files
- `Unique - Original Mix.mp3` - Currently active (smaller, better performance)
- `rhood-demo-audio.wav` - Large demo file (450MB) - available but not used

## Supported Formats
- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- M4A
- AAC

## File Size Considerations
- Current file: "Unique - Original Mix.mp3" (optimized size)
- Loading time: ~0.8 seconds simulated
- All mixes share the same audio file for demo purposes

## How to Switch Files
1. To use the large file: Change all references to `rhood-demo-audio.wav`
2. To use the smaller file: Keep current setup with `Unique - Original Mix.mp3`
3. The app will automatically use whichever file is referenced

## Performance Notes
- Smaller files load faster and use less memory
- Better for web browsers and mobile devices
- Consider file size when choosing audio files
