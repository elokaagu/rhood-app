# Audio Files for DJ Mixes

## Current Setup
All DJ mixes use the same demo audio file:
- `rhood-demo-audio.mp3` - Large demo audio file (450MB)

## Supported Formats
- MP3 (recommended)
- WAV
- M4A
- AAC

## File Size Considerations
- Current file: 450MB (very large)
- Loading time: ~2 seconds simulated
- All mixes share the same audio file for demo purposes

## How to Add Your File
1. Copy `rhood-demo-audio.mp3` to this folder
2. The app will automatically use it for all mixes
3. Consider compressing the file for better performance

## Performance Notes
- Large files take longer to load
- Consider using shorter clips for better UX
- Web browsers may have memory limitations with very large files
