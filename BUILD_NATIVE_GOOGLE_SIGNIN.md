## 🛠️ How to Build

### Step 1: Run the Build Command

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npx eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

### Step 2: Answer Prompts

EAS will ask:

- **"Do you want to log in to your Apple account?"** → Answer: `yes` (if needed)
- Build number will auto-increment: `31 → 32`

### Step 3: Wait for Build

- Build time: **15-30 minutes**
- You'll get a link to track progress on EAS dashboard
- Build happens on EAS cloud servers

### Step 4: Submit to TestFlight

After build completes:

```bash
npx eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

Or submit manually through App Store Connect.

## 🎯 What This Build Will Enable

### Before (Current v1.0.0):

- ❌ Google Sign-In opens browser (Safari)
- ❌ Shows Supabase domain name
- ❌ 2FA causes session timeout
- ❌ Poor user experience

### After (New v1.1.0):

- ✅ **Native Google Sign-In UI** (no browser!)
- ✅ **Shows "R/HOOD"** instead of database name
- ✅ **2FA works smoothly** (session persists)
- ✅ **Better UX** - feels like native app

## 📱 How Native Google Sign-In Works

```
User taps "Sign in with Google"
    ↓
Native Google Sign-In sheet appears (iOS system UI)
    ↓
Shows: "Sign in with Google to continue to R/HOOD"
    ↓
User selects Google account
    ↓
If 2FA enabled: Enter code (session persists)
    ↓
OAuth completes natively (no browser redirect)
    ↓
User signed in to R/HOOD ✅
```

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

After installing the new TestFlight build:

1. **Tap "Sign in with Google"**
2. **Look for:**

   - ✅ Native iOS bottom sheet (not Safari browser)
   - ✅ "to continue to **R/HOOD**" (not Supabase domain)
   - ✅ Smooth 2FA flow (no errors)
   - ✅ No browser popup

3. **If you see Safari browser:**
   - ❌ Build didn't include native module
   - Check build logs for errors
   - Rebuild if necessary

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still seeing browser/Supabase domain

**Cause:** Old build still installed  
**Fix:** Delete app from device, reinstall from TestFlight

### Issue: "RNGoogleSignin could not be found"

**Cause:** Native module not compiled  
**Fix:** Rebuild with `npx eas build --platform ios --profile production`

### Issue: Build fails

**Cause:** Missing credentials or configuration  
**Fix:** Check EAS dashboard logs, ensure Apple account is connected
