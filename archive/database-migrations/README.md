# Database Migration Files Archive

This directory contains SQL migration files that have been executed in the Supabase database and are no longer needed for active development.

## What's Here

These are historical SQL files that were used to:
- Set up the initial database schema
- Add new tables and columns
- Fix database issues and bugs
- Create indexes and constraints
- Set up Row Level Security policies
- Create storage buckets and policies

## Why Archived

These files have been moved here because:
- ✅ All migrations have been successfully applied to the database
- ✅ The current schema is documented in `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`
- ✅ Keeping them in the main database directory was cluttering the project
- ✅ They serve as a historical record of database changes

## Current Database State

The current database schema and setup is documented in:
- `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` - Complete schema documentation
- `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` - API documentation
- `docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Database setup instructions

## If You Need These Files

If you need to reference these migration files for any reason:
- They're safely archived here
- The final schema is documented in the main docs
- You can restore them if needed for reference

## Archive Date

Archived on: $(date)
Reason: Database migrations completed and schema documented
